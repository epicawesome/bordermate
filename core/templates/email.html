{{ flight.first_name }} need your help!


<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>You have gotten this email because {{ flight.first_name }} set up an automatic warning if we couldnâ€™t communicate for 3 hours after the flight {{ flight.first_name }} was on landed. The flight number is {{ flight.code }} and it departed {{ flight.destination }} on {{ flight.updated_at }}. Odds are {{ flight.first_name }} is stuck at the US border.</p>

<p>Please try to contact {{ flight.first_name }} before anything else. If you choose to seek legal counsel, the ACLU is a good place to start. Hopefully this will get sorted out shortly.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
